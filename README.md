# Food-Web-App
<br>
Using React and Redux for the Front End and Node.JS and Express for the Back End, I created a web app that connect to the "Spoonacular" API to provide food recipes. The page has functions for filtering, searching and creating custom recipes, which are saved in a database created with PostgresSQL and connected to the back through Sequelize.
